<p>This extension can improve efficiency of manual parameter
analysis for web penetration tests of either complex or numerous
applications. This can assist in tasks such as identifying sensitive data,
identifying hash algorithms, decoding parameters, and determining which
parameters are reflected in the response.</p>

<p>This extension performs an in-depth and intelligent parameter analysis of
all in-scope Burp traffic. Results are displayed in an interactive table
and can be sent directly to other Burp tools such as Repeater.</p>

<p>Requires Java version 7</p>
