<p>The Copy Request & Response Burp Suite extension adds new context menu entries that can be used to simply copy the request and response from the selected message to the clipboard.</p>

<p>The extension offers the following copy methods in the context menu of selected messages and request / responses:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Copy entire request & response of selected message</li>
	<li>Copy entire request & response header</li>
	<li>Copy entire request & response header + selected response data</li>
</ul>

Known issue: As a workaround for an issue in virtual machines, if the method with the selected response data is chosen, you have to wait 1.5 seconds before you can paste the copied text.
