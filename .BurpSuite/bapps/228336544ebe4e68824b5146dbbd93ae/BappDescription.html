<p>This extension gives Burp Suite the ability to find Java deserialization vulnerabilities.</p>

<p>It adds checks to both the active and passive scanner and can also be used in an "Intruder like" manual mode, with a dedicated tab.</p>

<p>The extension allows the user to <i>discover and exploit</i> Java Deserialization Vulnerabilities with different encodings (Raw, Base64, Ascii Hex, GZIP, Base64 GZIP) when the following libraries are loaded in the target JVM:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Apache Commons Collections 3 (up to 3.2.1), with five different chains</li>
	<li>Apache Commons Collections 4 (up to 4.4.0), with two different chains</li>
	<li>Spring (up to 4.2.2)</li>
	<li>Java 6 and Java 7 (up to Jdk7u21) without any weak library</li>
	<li>Hibernate 5</li>
	<li>JSON</li>
	<li>Rome</li>
	<li>Java 8 (up to Jdk8u20) without any weak library</li>
	<li>Apache Commons BeanUtils</li>
	<li>Javassist/Weld</li>
	<li>JBoss Interceptors</li>
	<li>Mozilla Rhino (two different chains)</li>
	<li>Vaadin</li>
</ul>

<p>Furthermore, URLSNDS payload has been introduced to actively detect Java
deserialization on the backend without any vulnerable library. This check
does the same job as the CPU attack vector already present in the &quot;Manual
testing&quot; section but can be safely added to the Burp Suite Active Scanner
engine, while the CPU payload should be use with caution.</p>

<p>After that a Java deserialization vulnerability has been found, a dedicated exploitation tab offers a comfortable interface to exploit deserialization vulnerabilities using frohoff ysoserial <a href="https://github.com/frohoff/ysoserial">https://github.com/frohoff/ysoserial</a></p>
