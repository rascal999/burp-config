<p>Description</p>
<p>This extension can be used to test websites for CORS misconfigurations. It can spot trivial misconfigurations, like arbitrary origin reflection, but also more subtle ones where a regex is not properly configured. An issue is created if a dangerous origin is reflected. If "Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true" is also set, the issue is rated high, otherwise low. Finally, the user has to decide whether the reflected Origin is intended (e.g. CDN) or whether it is a security issue.</p>

<p>Features</p>
