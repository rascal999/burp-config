<p>This extension takes a WSDL request, parses out the operations that are associated with the targeted
web service, and generates SOAP requests that can then be sent to the SOAP endpoints.</p>
<p>To use this extension, select a suitable item in Burp, and choose &quot;Parse 
WSDL&quot; from the context menu.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The extension builds upon the work done by Tom Bujok and his soap-ws project which is essentially the WSDL parsing portion of Soap-UI without the UI.</p>
<p>Requires Java version 8</p>
