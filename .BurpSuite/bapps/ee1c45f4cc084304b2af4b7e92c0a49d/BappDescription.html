<p>This extension provides a Proxy history-like view along with search filter capabilities for all Burp 
tools.</p>
<p>Requests without responses received are also shown and they are later updated as soon as response is received.
This might be helpful to troubleshoot e.g. scanning issues.</p>
<p>Requests and responses are split into separate columns (Repeater-like view).</p>
<p>If required the extension window can be detached from the Burp UI.</p>

<p>Requires Java version 7</p>
