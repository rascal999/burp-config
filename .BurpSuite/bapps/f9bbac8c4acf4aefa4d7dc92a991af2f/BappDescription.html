<p>Autorize is an extension aimed at helping the penetration tester to detect
authorization vulnerabilities, one of the more time-consuming tasks in a web
application penetration test.</p>

<p>It is sufficient to give to the extension the cookies of a low privileged
user and navigate the website with a high privileged user. The extension
automatically repeats every request with the session of the low privileged
user and detects authorization vulnerabilities.</p>

<p>It is also possible to repeat every request without any
cookies in order to detect authentication vulnerabilities in
addition to authorization ones.</p>

<p>The plugin works without any configuration, but is also highly
customizable, allowing configuration of the granularity of the authorization
enforcement conditions and also which requests the plugin must test and
which not. It is possible to save the state of the plugin and to export a
report of the authorization tests in HTML or in CSV.</p>

<p>The reported enforcement statuses are the following:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Bypassed! - Red color</li>
    <li>Enforced! - Green color</li>
    <li>Is enforced??? (please configure enforcement detector) - Yellow color</li>
</ol>
